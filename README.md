Project Status
--------------

This package is maintained by the Knowledge Management Branch of the [British Columbia Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/environment-climate-change).

What does it do?
----------------

Here is a summary of what `tidyhydat` does:

-   Provides functions (`hy_*`) that access hydrometric data from the HYDAT database, a national archive of Canadian hydrometric data and return tidy data.
-   Provides functions (`realtime_*`) that access Environment and Climate Change Canada's real-time hydrometric data source.
-   Provides functions (`search_*`) that can search through the approximately 7000 stations in the database and aid in generating station vectors
-   Keep functions as simple as possible. For example, for daily flows, the `hy_daily_flows()` function queries the database, *tidies* the data and returns a [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/) of daily flows.

Installation
------------

To install the `tidyhydat` package, you need to install the `remotes` package then the `tidyhydat` package

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/tidyhydat")
```

Then to load the package you need to use the `library()` function. When you install `tidyhydat`, several other packages will be installed as well. One of those packages, `dplyr`, is useful for data manipulations and is used regularly here. Even though `dplyr` is installed alongside `tidyhydat`, it is helpful to load it by itself as there are many useful functions contained within `dplyr`. A helpful `dplyr` tutorial can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html).

``` r
library(tidyhydat)
library(dplyr)
```

### HYDAT download

To use many of the functions in the `tidyhydat` package you will need to download a version of the HYDAT database, Environment and Climate Change Canada's database of historical hydrometric data then tell R where to find the database. Conveniently `tidyhydat` does all this for you via:

``` r
download_hydat()
```

This downloads the most recent version of HYDAT and then saves it in a location on your computer where `tidyhydat`'s function will look for it. Do be patient though as this takes a long time! To see where HYDAT was saved you can run `hy_dir()`. Now that you have HYDAT downloaded and ready to go, you are all set to begin some hydrologic analysis.

Usage
-----

Most functions in `tidyhydat` follow a common argument structure. We will use the `hy_daily_flows()` function for the following examples though the same approach applies to most functions in the package (See `ls("package:tidyhydat")` for a list of exported objects). Much of the functionality of `tidyhydat` originates with the choice of hydrometric stations that you are interested in. A user will often find themselves creating vectors of station numbers. There are several ways to do this.

The simplest case is if you would like to extract only station. You can supply this directly to the `station_number` argument:

``` r
hy_daily_flows(station_number = "08LA001")
#> No start and end dates specified. All dates available will be returned.
#> All station successfully retrieved
#> # A tibble: 29,159 x 5
#>    STATION_NUMBER       Date Parameter Value Symbol
#>             <chr>     <date>     <chr> <dbl>  <chr>
#>  1        08LA001 1914-01-01      FLOW   144   <NA>
#>  2        08LA001 1914-01-02      FLOW   144   <NA>
#>  3        08LA001 1914-01-03      FLOW   144   <NA>
#>  4        08LA001 1914-01-04      FLOW   140   <NA>
#>  5        08LA001 1914-01-05      FLOW   140   <NA>
#>  6        08LA001 1914-01-06      FLOW   136   <NA>
#>  7        08LA001 1914-01-07      FLOW   136   <NA>
#>  8        08LA001 1914-01-08      FLOW   140   <NA>
#>  9        08LA001 1914-01-09      FLOW   140   <NA>
#> 10        08LA001 1914-01-10      FLOW   140   <NA>
#> # ... with 29,149 more rows
```

Another method is to use `hy_stations()` to generate your vector which is then given the `station_number` argument. For example, we could take a subset for only those active stations within Prince Edward Island (Province code: `PE`) and then create vector for `hy_daily_flows()`:

``` r
PEI_stns <- hy_stations() %>%
  filter(HYD_STATUS == "ACTIVE") %>%
  filter(PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC == "PE") %>%
  pull(STATION_NUMBER)
#> All station successfully retrieved

PEI_stns
#> [1] "01CA003" "01CB002" "01CB004" "01CC002" "01CC005" "01CC010" "01CD005"

hy_daily_flows(station_number = PEI_stns)
#> No start and end dates specified. All dates available will be returned.
#> All station successfully retrieved
#> # A tibble: 98,562 x 5
#>    STATION_NUMBER       Date Parameter Value Symbol
#>             <chr>     <date>     <chr> <dbl>  <chr>
#>  1        01CA003 1961-08-01      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  2        01CB002 1961-08-01      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  3        01CA003 1961-08-02      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  4        01CB002 1961-08-02      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  5        01CA003 1961-08-03      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  6        01CB002 1961-08-03      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  7        01CA003 1961-08-04      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  8        01CB002 1961-08-04      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  9        01CA003 1961-08-05      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#> 10        01CB002 1961-08-05      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#> # ... with 98,552 more rows
```

We can also merge our station choice and data extraction into one unified pipe which accomplishes a single goal. For example, if for some reason we wanted all the stations in Canada that had the name "Canada" in them we could unify those selection and data extraction processes into a single pipe:

``` r
search_stn_name("canada") %>%
  pull(STATION_NUMBER) %>%
  hy_daily_flows()
#> No start and end dates specified. All dates available will be returned.
#> All station successfully retrieved
#> # A tibble: 76,679 x 5
#>    STATION_NUMBER       Date Parameter Value Symbol
#>             <chr>     <date>     <chr> <dbl>  <chr>
#>  1        01AK001 1918-08-01      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  2        01AK001 1918-08-02      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  3        01AK001 1918-08-03      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  4        01AK001 1918-08-04      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  5        01AK001 1918-08-05      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  6        01AK001 1918-08-06      FLOW    NA   <NA>
#>  7        01AK001 1918-08-07      FLOW  1.78   <NA>
#>  8        01AK001 1918-08-08      FLOW  1.78   <NA>
#>  9        01AK001 1918-08-09      FLOW  1.50   <NA>
#> 10        01AK001 1918-08-10      FLOW  1.78   <NA>
#> # ... with 76,669 more rows
```

These example illustrate a few ways that an vector can be generated and supplied to functions within `tidyhydat`.

### Real-time

To download real-time data using the datamart we can use approximately the same conventions discussed above. Using `realtime_dd()` we can easily select specific stations by supplying a station of interest:

``` r
realtime_dd(station_number = "08LG006")
```

Another option is to provide simply the province as an argument and download all stations from that province:

``` r
realtime_dd(prov_terr_state_loc = "PE")
```
