\title{Extract tidy water data}
\description{
tidyhydat provides a series of functions to make downloading and importing data from HYDAT into R a 
simple process for a user. HYDAT is the Canada national water data archive, published quarterly by 
the Government of Canada's Department of Environment and Climate Change. It is relational database that 
contains daily, monthly and annual data on water flow, water levels and sediment data. Functions are also 
provided to extract station metadata like position and record history.

In addition to historical data from HYDAT, tidyhydat also provide functions to access realtime water flow and 
water level data. This data is raw and unapproved originating directly from the station. 

Regardless of the data source, tidyhydat organizes all this data in a consistent format that allows the user to 
quickly and efficient connect with Canadian hydrological data.
